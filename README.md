# Scheme-Interpreter

Term project from CS251, with scripts included to use Clang (not included) to compile project and run files.

In a linux terminal, run command `make` and then `./interpreter < _test.scm` (or, in place of _test.scm, any valid scheme code)

All work is my own, except for build scripts and vestigal starter code provided by course staff.
